# README-Generator

## About
This command-line application uses node.js to dynamically generate a professional READ ME markdown file for a user. It aims to simplify the process for the user by quickly generating a README where they are given prompts about the nature of the project, which includes the title of the project, description, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests and questions such as their contact details.

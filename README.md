# README-Generator

## About
This command-line application uses node.js to dynamically generate a professional READ ME markdown file for a user. It aims to simplify the process for the user, by quickly generating a README where they are given prompts to respond to, such as the title of their project, description, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests and questions including their contact details.
